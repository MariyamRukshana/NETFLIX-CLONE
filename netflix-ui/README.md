## üéâ Acknowledgements <a name = "acknowledgement"></a>
* As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time data or specific acknowledgments related to projects or clones developed after my last update in September 2021. If a "Netflix-clone" or any similar project exists, I wouldn't have knowledge of its specific details, features, or acknowledgments. 

* Remember that when creating clones, it's essential to respect copyright laws and intellectual property rights. If the project is intended for personal or educational use only, it's generally acceptable. However, if there are plans to distribute or profit from the clone, it's crucial to ensure that all copyright and licensing requirements are met and to seek legal advice if needed.
